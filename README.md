# 🏠 Smart Home Project - Cisco Packet Tracer

This repository contains a **Smart Home Simulation** built with **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The project demonstrates the integration of IoT devices and networking concepts to create an automated smart home environment.

## 📂 Project Contents
- `FinalProject.pkt` → Main Packet Tracer project file (Smart Home topology).

## 🛠 Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer **8.2 or later**
  - [Download Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/courses/packet-tracer)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `FinalProject.pkt` using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Explore the smart home topology:
   - IoT devices (lights, fans, smart door, motion sensors, etc.)
   - Networking devices (router, switch, server, etc.)
   - Home Gateway for IoT device connectivity
4. Run the simulation mode to test device automation and interactions.

## 🔑 Features
- IoT device automation (lights, fan, door, sensors).
- Remote device control via IoT server.
- Networked topology connecting IoT devices with routers and switches.
- Smart environment simulation with triggers and conditions.

## 📖 Notes
- This project is for **educational purposes** to demonstrate IoT and networking.
- Can be extended with additional devices (e.g., smart cameras, alarms).
- Suggestions and improvements are welcome!
